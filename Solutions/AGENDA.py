# MAGIC ## Get Started with Databricks for Data Engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this course, you will learn basic skills that will allow you to use the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to perform a simple data engineering workflow. You will be given a tour of the workspace, and you will be shown how to work with notebooks. You will create a basic data engineering workflow while you perform tasks like creating and using compute resources, working with repositories, and creating and managing basic workflow jobs. The course will also introduce you to Databricks SQL. Finally, you will see how data is stored, managed, governed, and secured within the lakehouse.
